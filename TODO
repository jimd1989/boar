Features that boar is lacking, none of which are guaranteed to ever actually
be implemented. If you are interested in contributing to boar's codebase, these
may be good ideas to work on.

Info:
Running the info command (i), followed by a string, should return information
about the queried parameter to stderr. Like `i W'` would return the shape of
the modulator wave, etc.

Help:
A help (h) command followed by a command char could explain the purpose of
each command. 

Modify ByteBuffer:
Mixed-down int16_t samples can likely be written directly to it, without the
need for manual bit-shifting.

Sampling:
A dedicated wavetable based on a .WAV file specified in command-line args.
Various pitch-shifting algorithms like resampling, SOLA, and phase vocoding.
Controls over formants and the like. All frequency analysis should ideally take
place at initialization since the wavetable is known ahead of time. This data,
assuming it isn't too large, should be available in a dedicated type to ease
the computational impact of frequency domain pitching. Samples used as
envelopes should maybe use the first 2048 values of their tables.

Sample + Hold:
In addition to pure noise signals, there should be some kind of s+h feature.

Rotate Waves:
Maybe rotate some of the wavetables so that they are less awkward when used
as envelope stages.

Additional inputs:
The ability to assign parameters to modwheels, aftertouch, etc. The interface
for these devices would have to be generic, with an external program
converting their values into a proper boar command. Maybe two values could be 
read through mod (m/M) commands, and the routing of these values assigned
through the extra parameter (E) interface.

Improved band-limited wavetables:
A basic table-per-octave solution has been implemented. Oscillators will always
read from the table in the octave above to prevent aliasing. A more complex
solution, such as interpolating between two tables, is doable, but I am
satisfied with the way things sound for now.
