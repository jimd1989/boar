Features that boar is lacking, none of which are guaranteed to ever actually
be implemented. If you are interested in contributing to boar's codebase, these
may be good ideas to work on.

[YES] Remove echo:
Remove the echoing function in favor of extant unix constructs like tee.

[YES] New parser:
Parser can be better. Maybe take ideas from boar-parser experiment repo.
 - Reintroduce semicolon handling rather than rely on external command.
 - Allow multiple args, some of which are optional.
Other features, such as more oscs and better modulation routings, may come from
this.

[YES] Make single threaded:
The separate input/audio thread model is less than ideal. Remove this and make
boar serial so that it can respond to user input in a more deterministic manner.
Parallel processing can be reintroduced on a per voice basis, if it's worth the
overhead.

[MAYBE] Faster random values:
Values returned by rand() may be unnecessarily high quality. Consider a more
basic solution for a performance boost.

[YES] Additional oscs, envs:
Allow an arbitary number of oscillators and envelopes, and allow the user to
define the manner in which they modulate one-another.

[MAYBE] Remove wavetables:
Get rid of all wavetables and associated logic. Only use Colin Wallace's
Chebyshev approximation of a sine [-π/π]:

float approxsin(float x) {
    float pi_major = (float)M_PI;
    float pi_minor = -0.00000008742278;
    float x2 = x*x;
    float p11 = 0.00000000013291342;
    float p9  = p11*x2 + -0.000000023317787;
    float p7  = p9*x2  + 0.0000025222919;
    float p5  = p7*x2  + -0.00017350505;
    float p3  = p5*x2  + 0.0066208798;
    float p1  = p3*x2  + -0.10132118;
    return (x - pi_major - pi_minor) * (x + pi_major + pi_minor) * p1 * x;
}

[MAYBE] Fixed point phase:
Use fixed point phase, which may be simpler for wavetables (but harder for
everything else).

[MAYBE] Use stack more:
Locate performance critical data structures and keep them in stack vs heap.

[YES] Info:
Running the info command (i), followed by a string, should return information
about the queried parameter to stderr. Like `i W'` would return the shape of
the modulator wave, etc.

[YES] Help:
A help (h) command followed by a command char could explain the purpose of
each command. 

[MAYBE] Modify ByteBuffer:
Mixed-down int16_t samples can likely be written directly to it, without the
need for manual bit-shifting.

[MAYBE] Sample + Hold:
In addition to pure noise signals, there should be some kind of s+h feature.

[YES] Additional inputs:
The ability to assign parameters to modwheels, aftertouch, etc. The interface
for these devices would have to be generic, with an external program
converting their values into a proper boar command. Maybe two values could be 
read through mod (m/M) commands.
